## ðŸ“š About The Project

**Repeatro** is a modern, open-source vocabulary learning platform inspired by Anki. It uses spaced repetition (SM2 algorithm) to help users memorize words more efficiently. The system is split into a microservice-based Go backend and a Flutter-based cross-platform frontend (web + mobile).
